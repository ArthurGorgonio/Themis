# Themis
Code in folders : 

A = Code for [22]. This is the system A described in paper.

B,F = Folder contains the decision tree classifier code for [12] and fairness unaware decision tree

C,D  = Folder containing the code for [2] and [24]

fairness_unaware = Folder containing the code for fairness unaware algorithms. These algorithms correspond to systems E,G,H described in our paper.
